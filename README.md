# Superstore-Sales-Analysis

#Introduction
In today's business landscape, data-driven decision-making is crucial for success. The Superstore Sales Analysis and Forecasting project leverages 
the power of data to uncover patterns, trends, and key insights within a sales dataset. By employing advanced analytics and visualization techniques,
this project assists stakeholders in understanding historical sales performance and predicting future trends.
#Process
Data Preparation
The initial phase involved performing data cleaning tasks, including the removal of null values, the elimination of unnecessary columns,
handling duplicates, and adjusting data types to ensure data quality.

Data Modeling
The subsequent step was to create calculated measures and tables using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) in Power BI, enhancing the 
dataset's analytical capabilities

Data Analysis
Following data modeling, an in-depth data analysis was conducted within Power BI, utilizing various visualization techniques like matrices to 
identify trends in sales, region-wise sales, category-wise sales, and other pertinent insights.

Dashboard Creation
The project proceeded with the development of an interactive and dynamic dashboard in Power BI. This dashboard was designed to include bookmark features,
allowing for seamless navigation between different charts and visualizations to provide a more comprehensive view of the data.

Sales Forecasting
To deliver forward-looking insights, Power BI's advanced forecasting feature was utilized to perform a 10-day sales forecast. This forecasting capability
assists stakeholders in anticipating future trends and making informed decisions.

#Dashboard
The dashboard section offers an array of visualizations that empower users to explore and understand historical sales data. 
Key features of the dashboard include:

Visualization of monthly and yearly sales trends.
Comparison of sales across different categories and sub-categories.
Geographical distribution of sales.
